Use the AddOnGenerator to generate a new AddOn that implements this class. Parameters: Name Type Description logger GmeLogger gmeConfig GmeConfig Members blobClient :BlobClient Type: BlobClient branchName :string Type: string core :Core Type: Core gmeConfig :GmeConfig Type: GmeConfig logger :GmeLogger Type: GmeLogger project :Project Type: Project updateResult :AddOnUpdateResult Type: AddOnUpdateResult Methods addCommitMessage(msg) Creats or appends commit message for the current update-cycle. Parameters: Name Type Description msg string addNotification(message) Adds a notification to all sockets connected to the branch room. The notification will be sent after the update-callback has been invoked. Parameters: Name Type Description message string | object Message string or object containing message. Properties Name Type Argument Default Description message string If object it must contain a message. severity string &lt;optional&gt; 'info' Severity level ('success', 'info', 'warn', 'error') configure(configuration, callback) Configures the AddOn Parameters: Name Type Description configuration object callback function getDefaultQueryParams() Returns the default values of the Query Parameters. Returns: Type object getDescription() A detailed description of this AddOn and its purpose. It can be one or more sentences. Returns: Type string getName() Readable name of this AddOn that can contain spaces. Returns: Type string getQueryParamsStructure() Structure of query parameters with names, descriptions, minimum, maximum values, default values and type definitions. Returns: Type Array.&lt;object&gt; getVersion() Current version of this AddOn using semantic versioning. Returns: Type string initialize(rootNode, commitObj, callback) Called once when the AddOn is started for the first time. Parameters: Name Type Description rootNode object commitObj object callback function query(commitHash, queryParams, callback) Queries are typically invoked by users from a client. The AddOn is not suppose to make any changes to either the model's or the AddOn's state. (Since users can share a running instance of an AddOn). Parameters: Name Type Description commitHash string State of the invoker. queryParams object Values based on the 'getQueryParametersStructure'. callback function resolves with PluginResult. setToken(token) Overwrite this if you are sending requests to the webgme server. Make sure to still update the blob-clients token. Parameters: Name Type Description token update(rootNode, commitObj, callback) This is invoked after each commit to the branch. AddOns are allowed to make changes on updates, but should not persist by themselves. The manager/monitor will persist after each AddOn has had its way (ordered by the &quot;usedAddOn&quot; registry in the rootNode). Changes made by AddOns do not trigger a new update for other addOns.

Type: Object.&lt;string, module:Core~Node&gt; namespace :string The namespace the META nodes are coming from (set by invoker). The default is the full meta, i.e. the empty string namespace.
